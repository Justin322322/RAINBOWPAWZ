# Production Image Upload Fix

## Issue

In serverless environments (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Railway), the filesystem is read-only. You cannot write files to `/public/uploads/`.

**Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/var/task/public/uploads/reviews'`

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Cloud Storage (Recommended for Production)

Use a cloud storage service like:
- **Vercel Blob Storage** (recommended for Vercel)
- **AWS S3**
- **Cloudinary**
- **UploadThing**

#### Example with Vercel Blob:

```bash
npm install @vercel/blob
```

Update `src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { put } from '@vercel/blob';

// Handle image uploads
let imageUrls: string[] = [];
if (imageFiles.length > 0) {
  for (const file of imageFiles) {
    try {
      const blob = await put(`reviews/${booking_id}_${Date.now()}.${file.name.split('.').pop()}`, file, {
        access: 'public',
      });
      imageUrls.push(blob.url);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error uploading to Vercel Blob:', error);
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Disable Image Upload in Production

If you don't need images in production yet, the current code will gracefully skip image uploads and save the review without images.

**Current behavior**:
- ✅ Review is saved successfully
- ⚠️ Images are skipped with warning
- ✅ No errors shown to user
- ✅ Review displays without images

### Option 3: Use Traditional Server

Deploy to a traditional server (not serverless) where you have filesystem access:
- VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode)
- Dedicated server
- Docker container with persistent storage

## Current Status

The code has been updated to:
- ✅ Handle serverless environment gracefully
- ✅ Log warnings instead of crashing
- ✅ Save reviews without images if upload fails
- ✅ Continue processing normally

## Recommendation

For production, implement **Option 1 (Cloud Storage)** for best results:

1. Sign up for Vercel Blob Storage (free tier available)
2. Install `@vercel/blob` package
3. Update the image upload code
4. Images will be stored in the cloud
5. URLs will be saved in database
6. Everything works seamlessly

## Temporary Workaround

For now, reviews work but without images in production. This is acceptable for testing. Implement cloud storage before going live with the image feature.
