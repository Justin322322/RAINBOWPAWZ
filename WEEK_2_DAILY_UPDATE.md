## 🔬 **Technical Analysis Summary**

### **Event Listener Pattern Excellence:**
Every single event listener in the codebase follows this perfect pattern:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleEvent = (event: Event) => {
    // handler logic
  };
  
  if (condition) {
    document.addEventListener('event', handleEvent);
  }
  
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('event', handleEvent);
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### **Timer Pattern Excellence:**
All timer usage has been verified to follow proper cleanup:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    // timer logic
  }, delay);
  
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```
